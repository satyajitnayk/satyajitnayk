# Hi there, I'm Satyajit Nayak 👋

## 🚀 Where I'm Headed

After several years working with **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **AWS**, I'm now focused on building **high-performance systems** and **cloud-native infrastructure**. I'm especially excited about:

- Systems programming with **Go** and **Rust**
- Scalable backend architecture and distributed systems
- Building infrastructure tools, orchestrators, and internal platforms
- Solving performance, reliability, and scale challenges

I'm currently:

- 🔍 **Open to new full-time opportunities** — particularly on teams tackling **hard engineering problems at scale**
- 🤝 **Available on weekends** to contribute to **open-source** or meaningful **infra/backend projects**
- 💡 Eager to collaborate with engineers pushing the limits of system design, performance, and resilience
