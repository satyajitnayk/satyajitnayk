# Hi there, I'm Satyajit Nayak üëã

I‚Äôm a **Backend Software Engineer** with **4 years of experience**, Currently, I work at **Docupilot**, where I specialize in **serverless applications** using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **AWS Lambda services**. My role involves designing robust APIs, optimizing performance, and integrating third-party systems to enhance functionality.

I work with Go for high-performance backends, SQL/NoSQL databases, and deploy on AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, SQS). I also focus on microservices, scalable design patterns, and Docker for containerization.

> The best players in any field rise to the top when their peers take a bet on them and invest in their growth. In software engineering, companies like **WhatsApp**, **Slack**, and **Stripe** became successful because experienced leaders nurtured and believed in the potential of emerging talent, benefiting both individuals and the organization as a whole. This culture of support drives innovation and success. **If given the opportunity to work alongside such experts, I would embrace the chance to learn, contribute, and grow together, striving for collective excellence and impactful results.**

## üéØ **What I'm Working Towards**

While **Node.js** remains my primary tool at work, **Go** is where my passion currently lies. I‚Äôm fascinated by its **concurrency model**, **performance optimizations**, and how well it scales for backend systems. Over the past few months, I‚Äôve worked on several **Go projects** to get hands-on experience.  

Although **Go** is my focus right now, I want to emphasize that **language is not a barrier** for me. I‚Äôm always excited to explore new technologies and frameworks. The reason I‚Äôm diving deep into **Go** is because of its outstanding features that align well with my current projects and aspirations, particularly in high-performance systems and distributed architectures.

In the future, I‚Äôm aiming to grow within **distributed systems**, **high-performance backend engineering**, and **high-frequency trading (HFT)**. I‚Äôm looking for opportunities where I can collaborate with experts and continue to contribute, grow, and tackle complex technical challenges.

## üöÄ **Choosing a Company to Grow**

As I continue my journey, I am looking for companies that foster **growth**, **innovation**, and **excellence**. Here‚Äôs a framework I use to evaluate potential opportunities:

| **Aspect**               | **Criteria**                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Team Quality**          | Are the team members smart, high-performing, and inspiring?                                   |  
| **Growth Opportunities**  | Does the role offer ownership, learning, and problem-solving challenges?                      |  
| **Company Momentum**      | Is the company growing, profitable, or solving impactful problems?                           |   
| **Tenure Potential**      | Are there long-term opportunities to master tough challenges?                                |    
| **Standards & Culture**   | Are high standards and a culture of excellence evident?                                      |  
| **Mission Impact**        | Is the company focused on meaningful, high-impact work over superficial perks?               |   
| **Urgency & Iteration**   | Does the company prioritize rapid iteration and high urgency in its work processes?          |
